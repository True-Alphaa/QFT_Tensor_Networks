# QFT_Tensor_Networks
This repository contains a report on simulating the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) using tensor networks, utilizing Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPO). It covers theoretical background, implementation, runtime comparisons with FFT, and future work. Authored by Edara Yaswanth Balaji, supervised by Dr. Archak Purkayastha.
